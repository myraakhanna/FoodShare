        At FoodShare, we believe that good food should never go to waste when there are people who need it.</p>
        <p>We’re a community-powered platform built to bridge the gap between surplus and scarcity. Every day, restaurants, supermarkets, caterers, and individuals find themselves with excess food—perfectly good, but often destined for the bin. At the same time, thousands of people go hungry, and food banks and shelters work tirelessly to meet the need. Our mission is to connect these dots.</p>
        <p>With a minimal, mobile-first design, our platform makes it incredibly easy for anyone to donate food in real-time. Whether you're a business or an individual, you can post surplus food, find nearby charities, and even schedule a pickup—all in just a few taps. Our goal is to make food donation as seamless and intuitive as ordering takeout.</p>
        <p>We prioritize sustainability, inclusivity, and impact. That means quick load times for low-end devices, multilingual support, icon-based navigation, and real-time updates showing how much food has been saved and how many people have been helped.</p>
        <p>At our core, we’re about community—using technology to bring people together for a common cause. When you donate through our platform, you're not just preventing food waste; you're feeding someone in need, supporting local organizations, and becoming part of a movement that believes in shared responsibility and small actions with big outcomes.</p>
        <p>Let’s make food go where it’s needed most.
            Together, we can turn surplus into support.</p>
